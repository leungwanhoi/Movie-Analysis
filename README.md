# Movie-Analysis


# Abstract
The study identified several challenges in the data cleaning process, such as dealing with missing values and conflicting data. The findings suggest that careful data cleaning and preprocessing are essential for producing accurate and reliable insights about the factors that contribute to the success of movies. Further research could explore the relationship between critical ratings and box office revenue, or investigate the impact of social media on the success of movies.

After cleaning the data, descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis techniques were used to identify patterns and relationships between the variables. The results showed that the most successful movies tended to be in the action and adventure genres, with high-budget productions and high-profile casts. Additionally, movies released during certain times of the year, such as the summer blockbuster season, tended to perform better at the box office.

# Introduction
These files contain metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset. The dataset consists of movies released on or before July 2017. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts and vote averages.

This dataset also has files containing 26 million ratings from 270,000 users for all 45,000 movies. Ratings are on a scale of 1-5 and have been obtained from the official GroupLens website.

# Objectives
This study aimed to analyze the factors that contribute to the success of movies using data cleaning techniques in R. The dataset included information on movie characteristics such as genre, cast, budget, release date, and box office revenue. The data cleaning process involved identifying and addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
